# Exercise: Applying reactive functions

> We are examining the percentage of days with unsafe PM2.5 percentages in different counties of Washington State.
> PM2.5 refers to particles in the air that are tiny and dangerous to inhale.

I am giving you a small dataset and a template for your code :)

**You want to add:**

- A widget to filter the data
- A table of the data youâ€™ve filtered to
- A plot to display the filtered data

Since the table and theplot both use same filtered data, please use a reactive function!
